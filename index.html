                    <li>1 can of condensed milk;</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of cocoa powder (you can use chocolate powder, but cocoa powder gives a more
                        intense flavor);</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of margarine or butter;</li>
                    <li>Chocolate sprinkles (optional, for topping);</li>

                    <li>Mix the ingredients: In a microwave-safe bowl, add the condensed milk, cocoa powder and
                        margarine.</li>
                    <li>Microwave: Place the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds. Remove and stir well. Return to the
                        microwave for another 30 seconds and stir again.</li>
                    <li>Cook for another 1-2 minutes: Repeat the process of heating for 30 seconds and stirring until
                        the mixture starts to come away from the sides of the bowl. This is what indicates that the
                        brigadeiro is ready.</li>
                    <li>Let it cool: When the brigadeiro is ready, remove it from the microwave and let it cool for a
                        few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Shape the brigadeiros: With your hands greased with butter, make small balls with the brigadeiro
                        mixture. If you prefer, roll them in sprinkles to cover them.</li>
                    <li>Serve: After it has cooled, just serve and enjoy!</li>
